## What is ep__page_breaks?
An Etherpad Plugin to apply the ep__page_breaks functionality in a pad. (describe in minimum 50 Letters what it is)
Currently supports:
* ep__page_breaks functionality 1
* ep__page_breaks functionality 2
* ep__page_breaks functionality 3
* ep__page_breaks functionality 4

## ep__page_breaks Usage
Experimental.  As a special attribute on Etherpad, some weirdness may be experienced by using ep__page_breaks.

## ep__page_breaks History
I decided to copy/paste the ep_t3 over ep__page_breaks to create that plugin.
